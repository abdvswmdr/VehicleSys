** Installation

*** Prerequisites

- Linux Ubuntu 24.04
- [Qt 5.15][https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-5.15-released]>
- CMake 3.20+
- C++17  
- PulseAudio/PipeWire 

*** Manual Installation
#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev qtpositioning5-dev qtlocation5-dev \
       qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5multimedia5-plugins libqt5multimedia5 \
       cmake build-essential

  # For audio codec support, you may also need:
  sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly

  # Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/abdvswmdr/VehicleSys 
  cd Vehicle-Infotainment

  mkdir build && cd build # Build the project
  cmake ..
  make

  ./VehicleSys # Run the application

  # Add music in directory
  # (supported formats: MP3, MP4, WAV, OGG, M4A, AAC, FLAC, WMA)
  mkdir music 
  cp </path/to/your/music/>.mp3 music/
  #+end_src

** Configuration

If you encounter the error "Qt Multimedia not available", follow these steps:
#+begin_src bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5multimedia5-plugins libqt5multimedia5

pactl info              # PulseAudio/PipeWire status
pactl list sinks short  # audio output 

speaker-test -t sine -f 440 -l 1 # Test system audio

rm -rf build/*
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
#+end_src

*** Music System Architecture

- =MediaController=: Handles audio playback, playlist management, and media controls
- =AudioController=: Manages volume levels and audio routing
- =MusicPlayerStatus=: Real-time display component showing current track info
- =Integration=: Seamless volume synchronization between UI and audio backend

When Qt Multimedia is properly configured, you should see:
#+begin_src bash
MediaController: Qt Multimedia available, audio role set to MusicRole
MediaController: Initial volume set to: 50
Found <X> audio files in "/path/to/audio"
Loaded <X> tracks
#+end_src

Instead of the fallback message:
```
MediaController: Qt Multimedia not available - audio playback will not work
Loaded 19 tracks (simulation mode)
```

**🔧 Troubleshooting

#**Common QML Errors and Solutions

##**1. "StatusBar is not a type" Error
=Problem=: QML component not registered in qmldir
```
qrc:/ui/RightScreen/RightScreen.qml:24:5: StatusBar is not a type
```

=Solution=: Ensure `ui/RightScreen/qmldir` contains:
```
StatusBar 1.0 StatusBar.qml
```

#### 2. "Cannot anchor item to self" Error
=Problem=: Circular anchor reference in QML
```
qrc:/ui/BottomBar/BottomBar.qml:155:3: QML VolumeControlComponent: Cannot anchor item to self.
```

=Solution=: Remove self-referencing anchors:
```qml
// WRONG
anchors.left: volumeControl.left

// CORRECT  
width: 80
anchors.right: parent.right
```

#### 3. "ReferenceError: albumArt is not defined"
=Problem=: Missing id property on QML element
```
qrc:/ui/BottomBar/MusicPlayerStatus.qml:39: ReferenceError: albumArt is not defined
```

=Solution=: Add id to the referenced element:
```qml
Rectangle {
    id: albumArt  // Add this line
    width: parent.height
    // ... rest of properties
}
```

#### 4. "Unable to assign [undefined] to bool"
=Problem=: Property doesn't exist on controller object
```
qrc:/ui/Dashboard/VehicleDashboard.qml:335:3: Unable to assign [undefined] to bool
```

=Solution=: Check property exists in C++ controller:
```qml
// WRONG (if highBeam property doesn't exist)
active: vehicleData.highBeam

// CORRECT (use existing property)
active: vehicleData.headlights
```

### Audio System Issues

#### 1. No Audio Output
=Check audio system status=:
```bash
pactl info
pactl list sinks short
pulseaudio --check  # Should return nothing if running
```

#### 2. GStreamer Plugin Issues
=Install additional codecs=:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
```

#### 3. Qt Multimedia Detection
=Verify Qt Multimedia is linked=:
```bash
ldd VehicleSys | grep Qt5Multimedia
```

Should show: `libQt5Multimedia.so.5 => /usr/lib/...`
